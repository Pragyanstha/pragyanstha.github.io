Hi! I am a currently a PhD student under the supervision of [Prof. Itaru Kitahara](https://sites.google.com/image.iit.tsukuba.ac.jp/kitahara/home?authuser=0) at the [Computer Vision and Image Media lab](https://www.image.iit.tsukuba.ac.jp/), University of Tsukuba. My research interests include 3D reconstruction, 6DoF pose estimation and camera calibration. Currently, I am working on 2D-3D registration and few-view reconstruction of X-ray images and 3DCT scans.  
  
Why work on X-ray images?  
  
Because they are challenging and simple at the same time. Well established methods for reflective images like the one you are looking at right now, usually do not work on transmissive images such as X-ray images because of the fundamental difference in their rendering model. I want to create a unified framework for 3D CV tasks on transmissive images.
